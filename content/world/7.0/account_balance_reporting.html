<p>The module allows the user to create account balance reports and templates,
comparing the values of 'accounting concepts' between two fiscal years
or a set of fiscal periods.</p>
<p>Accounting concepts values can be calculated as the sum of some account balances,
the sum of its children, other account concepts or constant values.</p>
<p>Generated reports are stored as objects on the server,
so you can check them anytime later or edit them
(to add notes for example) before printing.</p>
<p>The module lets the user add new templates of the reports concepts,
and associate them an specific &quot;XML report&quot; (OpenERP RML files for example)
with the design used when printing.
So it is very easy to add predefined country-specific official reports.</p>
<p>The user interface has been designed to be as much user-friendly as it can be.</p>
<p>Note: It has been designed to meet Spanish/Spain localization needs,
but it might be used as a generic accounting report engine.</p>
